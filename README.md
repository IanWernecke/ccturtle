# ccturtle

This repository is meant to house the code for a computercraft mining turtle.

It can be obtained by a created pc by running:

"/openp/github get IanWernecke/ccturtle/master/setup /setup"

"/setup"

This will create a directory at "/turtle" that should house all of the common code for managing your mining turtles.

It is recommended that the above script be kept at "/update" and run when an update is desired.
