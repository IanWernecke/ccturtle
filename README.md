# ccturtle

This repository is meant to house the code for a computercraft mining turtle.

It can be obtained by a created pc by running:

"wget run https://raw.github.com/IanWernecke/ccturtle/master/update"

This should download all of the files relevant to keeping your turtle up to date and loading the useful APIs!
